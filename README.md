# Ngau

An interactive map showing the state of child rights around the world.

This project started as a way to make sense of complex, scattered data—something visual, grounded, and a little more human. It brings together the KidsRights Index with other global indicators like child marriage, labor, FGM, and violent discipline.

Some countries have detailed data. Others don’t. That absence is part of the story too.

This map wasn’t built for clicks or visibility. It was made to explore and to better understand the patterns behind child rights data, and to offer that understanding to others who might want the same.

It’s not affiliated with any organization.
